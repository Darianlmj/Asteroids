# Asteroids

Welcome to Asteroids - the remake. This is a command-line interface (CLI) program
based off the popular arcade game Asteroids. In this game, you are a spacecraft attempting to fend off incoming rogue asteroids. To win, you have to destroy all asteroids by firing lasers from the spacecraft but if an asteroid manages to reach the left edge of the map - you lose.
